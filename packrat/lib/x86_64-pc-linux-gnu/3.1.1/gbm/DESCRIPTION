Description: This package implements extensions to Freund and
    Schapire's AdaBoost algorithm and Friedman's gradient boosting
    machine. Includes regression methods for least squares, absolute
    loss, t-distribution loss, quantile regression, logistic,
    multinomial logistic, Poisson, Cox proportional hazards partial
    likelihood, AdaBoost exponential loss, Huberized hinge loss, and
    Learning to Rank measures (LambdaMart).
