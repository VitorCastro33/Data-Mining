in this section we will use the performaceEstimation function to estimate and analyse the mean square error of five different models in the regression tank for the TotalBurnArea using 1x10-Fold Cross Validation method, the models are:
 
 - bagging 
 - support vector machines
 - multiple linear regression
 - regression trees
 - random trees


```{r}
res = performanceEstimation(
  	PredTask(TotalBurntArea ~ .,train_data), 
		workflowVariants(learner=c("bagging","svm","lm","rpartXse","randomForest")),
		EstimationTask(metrics="mse",method=CV(nReps=1,nFolds=10)))
```

Obtaining the plot:

```{r}
plot(res)
```

We can rank the models as follows:

```{r}
rankWorkflows(res,5)
```
